# Polynomial Regression with Regularization - Project Overview

Welcome to this project, where we explore and implement polynomial regression along with manual regularization techniques to reduce overfitting and enhance the generalizability of the model. This project also includes a comparison of different regression models to find the best fit for our data.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to demonstrate the following key concepts in machine learning:

1. **Polynomial Regression**: We start by fitting a polynomial regression model, expanding the features with different polynomial degrees to observe the impact on model performance.
2. **Manual Regularization**: Unlike typical usage of ready-made functions like Ridge or Lasso, we manually apply L2 regularization to the polynomial model to demonstrate the mathematical approach and understand its effect on model coefficients.
3. **Model Comparison**: We train and evaluate different regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Decision Tree Regression. We use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to compare their performance.

The goal is to learn how to effectively apply regularization to polynomial regression and to understand how different models behave when applied to the same dataset.

## Dataset

- The dataset is a simple `.npy` file (`data.npy`), containing one-dimensional data points. You can modify the dataset as per your requirement.
- Make sure to place the `data.npy` file in the appropriate directory (i.e., `/content/data.npy` if you're running this on Google Colab).

## Key Concepts Implemented

### 1. Polynomial Regression
We fit a polynomial regression model with varying degrees (from 1 to 5) to observe how increasing the complexity of the model affects the training and test error. This helps in identifying potential overfitting and underfitting issues.

### 2. Regularization
We manually implement L2 regularization to control the magnitude of model coefficients and reduce overfitting. This part of the project involves calculating the penalty directly instead of using pre-built libraries like `Ridge` from Scikit-Learn.

### 3. Model Comparison
We compare the following models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regression**

We evaluate these models on various error metrics to determine the model that best balances bias and variance.

## Results and Observations
- **Training and Test Error**: We visualize the training and test errors for different models and polynomial degrees to understand the relationship between model complexity and generalizability.
- **Regularization Impact**: We observe how manually implemented L2 regularization impacts the model coefficients and prevents overfitting.

## Future Improvements
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to more robustly assess model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search to find the best parameters for each model.
- **Additional Models**: Explore other regression models such as Random Forest or Support Vector Regression to see how they compare.
